# 8080emulator
WIP emulator for Intel 8080 processor written in C.

Emulator.c contains code for emulation. Dissasembler.c contains an 8080 disassembler that can be used to analyze ROMs. 

Next steps include thorough testing, as well as I/O implementation so graphics and input can be handled. My ultimate goal is to emulate a simple game (such as space invaders) in real time!
